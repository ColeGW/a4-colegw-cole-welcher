A simple blob music visualizer. There are three songs to pick from as well as two drops downs on the top right that allow you to change RGB Colors
as well as Bloom affects. I followed a tutorial by Wael Yasmina for the blob as I have no experience in Three.js and it was helpful to have someone explain
stuff when I got lost. The challenge I faced was my lack of experience with Three JS as I have never used it before but it is really COOOL!!!
